       "[\"Summary : In coronary artery disease (CAD), the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to your heart muscle grow hardened and narrowed. You may try treatments such as lifestyle changes, medicines, and angioplasty, a procedure to open the arteries. If these treatments don't help, you may need coronary artery bypass surgery.    The surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to the heart. The surgeon takes a healthy piece of vein from the leg or artery from the chest or wrist. Then the surgeon attaches it to the coronary artery, just above and below the narrowed area or blockage. This allows blood to bypass (get around) the blockage. Sometimes people need more than one bypass.    The results of the surgery usually are excellent. Many people remain symptom-free for many years. You may need surgery again if blockages form in the grafted arteries or veins or in arteries that weren't blocked before. Lifestyle changes and medicines may help prevent arteries from becoming clogged again.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\"]"

      "**Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (CABG)** is a procedure used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD), where arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. Here’s a concise overview:\n",
      "\n",
      "### **What Is CABG?**  \n",
      "- **Purpose**: To restore blood flow to the heart muscle by creating a new pathway (bypass) around blocked or narrowed arteries.  \n",
      "- **Method**: A healthy blood vessel (graft) is used to bypass the blocked section, allowing blood to flow around the blockage.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Types of Grafts**  \n",
      "- **Peripheral Artery Graft (PAG)**: From the leg (e.g., saphenous vein).  \n",
      "- **Internal Thoracic Artery (ITA)**: From the chest.  \n",
      "- **Great Saphenous Vein (GSV)**: A common PAG.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Procedure Steps**  \n",
      "1. **Incisions**: Small incisions are made in the chest (sternal) and arm (for the graft).  \n",
      "2. **Graft Placement**: The graft is connected to the artery and the heart.  \n",
      "3. **Bypass Creation**: The graft is used to reroute blood flow around the blockage.  \n",
      "4. **Closure**: Incisions are closed, and the patient is monitored for recovery.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **When Is It Needed?**  \n",
      "- **Indications**: Severe CAD, angina, or a heart attack.  \n",
      "- **When to Consider**: When medications are ineffective, or when there’s a high risk of heart attack.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Risks and Complications**  \n",
      "- **Infection** (e.g., endocarditis).  \n",
      "- **Bleeding** or blood clots.  \n",
      "- **Heart attack** during surgery.  \n",
      "- **Graft failure** (e.g., the bypass doesn’t work properly).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Recovery**  \n",
      "- **Hospital Stay**: Typically 3–7 days.  \n",
      "- **Recovery Time**: 2–6 weeks for most patients.  \n",
      "- **Activity**: Gradual return to normal activities, avoiding heavy lifting or strenuous exercise.  \n",
      "- **Follow-Up**: Regular check-ups with a cardiologist to monitor heart health and graft function.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Lifestyle Changes**  \n",
      "- **Smoking cessation**.  \n",
      "- **Diet and exercise** to prevent future heart attacks.  \n",
      "- **Medication management** (e.g., statins, beta-blockers).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Alternatives**  \n",
      "- **Stenting** (small metal tube placed in the artery to keep it open).  \n",
      "- **Catheterization** (minimally invasive procedures).  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note**: CABG is a major procedure with potential risks, so it’s usually recommended after evaluating the patient’s overall health and disease severity. Always consult a cardiologist or surgeon for personalized advice.\n"

You may try treatments such as lifestyle changes, medicines, and angioplasty, a procedure to open the arteries. If these treatments don't help, you may need coronary artery bypass surgery.    The surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to the heart. The surgeon takes a healthy piece of vein from the leg or artery from the chest or wrist. Then the surgeon attaches it to the coronary artery, just above and below the narrowed area or blockage. This allows blood to bypass (get around) the blockage. Sometimes people need more than one bypass.    The results of the surgery usually are excellent. Many people remain symptom-free for many years. You may need surgery again if blockages form in the grafted arteries or veins or in arteries that weren't blocked before. Lifestyle changes and medicines may help prevent arteries from becoming clogged again.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\"])"

      "Diabetes is a complex group of metabolic disorders characterized by elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). It occurs when the body cannot properly regulate blood sugar, often due to insufficient insulin production (type 1 or type 2 diabetes) or impaired insulin function (type 2 diabetes). The pancreas, an organ behind the stomach, produces insulin, which helps cells absorb glucose for energy. \n",

      "**Main Types of Diabetes**:\n",
      "1. **Type 1 Diabetes**: \n",
      "   - Autoimmune condition where the body destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.\n",
      "   - Usually diagnosed in children or young adults.\n",
      "   - Requires lifelong insulin therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Type 2 Diabetes**: \n",
      "   - Most common form, often linked to obesity, physical inactivity, family history, and ethnicity.\n",
      "   - Characterized by insulin resistance and reduced insulin production.\n",
      "   - Managed with lifestyle changes, medications (e.g., metformin), or insulin therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Gestational Diabetes**: \n",
      "   - Develops during pregnancy, often resolving post-partum.\n",
      "   - Increases risk of type 2 diabetes in the mother and child.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Causes**:\n",
      "- **Genetic Factors**: Inherited predispositions.\n",
      "- **Environmental Factors**: Diet, physical inactivity, obesity, and exposure to certain toxins.\n",
      "- **Combination of Genes and Environment**: Most cases involve a complex interplay of genetic and lifestyle factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Complications**:\n",
      "- **Long-term risks**: Heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, nerve damage, and poor wound healing.\n",
      "- **Other issues**: Increased susceptibility to infections, depression, and pregnancy complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Takeaway**: While the exact causes of diabetes are not fully understood, genetic and environmental factors interact to increase risk. Management involves lifestyle changes, medication, or insulin therapy, depending on the type and severity.\n"

       " 'answer': \"Williams syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, distinctive facial features, and heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems.  People with Williams syndrome typically have difficulty with visual-spatial tasks such as drawing and assembling puzzles, but they tend to do well on tasks that involve spoken language, music, and learning by repetition (rote memorization). Affected individuals have outgoing, engaging personalities and tend to take an extreme interest in other people. Attention deficit disorder (ADD), problems with anxiety, and phobias are common among people with this disorder.  Young children with Williams syndrome have distinctive facial features including a broad forehead, a short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, and a wide mouth with full lips. Many affected people have dental problems such as teeth that are small, widely spaced, crooked, or missing. In older children and adults, the face appears longer and more gaunt.  A form of cardiovascular disease called supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) occurs frequently in people with Williams syndrome. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a narrowing of the large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta). If this condition is not treated, the aortic narrowing can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart failure. Other problems with the heart and blood vessels, including high blood pressure (hypertension), have also been reported in people with Williams syndrome.  Additional signs and symptoms of Williams syndrome include abnormalities of connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs) such as joint problems and soft, loose skin. Affected people may also have increased calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemia) in infancy, developmental delays, problems with coordination, and short stature. Medical problems involving the eyes and vision, the digestive tract, and the urinary system are also possible.\",\n",
